						<h3>Oil and Gas</h3>
							<p class="resource_text">
								The oil and gas industry has long been among the leading practitioners of supercomputing technology, as 3D seismic data processing has been a staple of the sector for years. Recent developments in the industry have added additional layers of complexity and opportunity that promise to improve exploration and production operations including, but not limited to, Permanent Reservoir Monitoring(PRM), Basin Analysis and Seismic visualizations. Within todays's computing environments, energy companies must deal with the major unstructured big data challenges that require innovative high performance computing models to enable the fastest access to the available datasets. The massively parallel I/O capability provided by our architecture delivers exceptional bandwidth performance combined with unique scalable IOPS, thus accelerating the time needed to achieve results.
							</p>
							<h3>Grid Optimization</h3>
							<p class="resource_text">
								
                               With the recent and future challenges posed by the growing volume,velocity and variety of data in the energy industry, utility companies must be capable of high volume data management and advanced analytics that are necessary to transfrom data sets into actionable insights. There is a huge demand for value driven predictive analytics and mission critical applications that support the smart grids and related networks. Utility companies are turning to techniques such as massive data filtering and anlyzing data using tailored analytics tools that can process a variety of data in the native format and bring arrays of parallel processors to bear on incoming data. Our RONNIEE Express technology is a Massively Parallel Data Processor platform that is second to none in multidimensional data managemnt and analysis.

						<div id="biotech" class="fade">
							<h3>Biotech</h3>
							<p class="resource_text">
								Research institutions, pharmaceutical companies and Biotechnology firms that are involved in genomics, molecular modeling and simulations  are producing gigantic datasets that are growing at the speed of light. This explosion in genomic and proteomic information, especially from the latest Next-Gen Sequencers, and the emergence of data-intensive molecular diagnostic techniques demand a scalable, high performance storage infrastructure. Our solution can deliver a 100x performance improvement compared with the best solutions available on the market.

							<h3>Finance</h3>
							<p class="resource_text">
								In an industry where time is money, we provide an In-Memory data plane to enhance business-critical applications allowing simulation accuracy, greatly increased response times and military grade reliability. The sheer volume and growth rate of big data for risk analysis, research, and post-trade analytics can strain storage resources. Monte Carlo simulations, tick data analyses, and portfolio optimization activities  all require high performance parallel storage to satisfy the demand for fast, shared access to large and small files alike. This data explosion is driving the need for fast, extremely scalable, easy to manage, and affordable high performance storage systems like RONNIEE Express that can effectively handle the constraints of current and future data intensive financial workflows.

							<h3>A breakthrough architecture for Big Data analysis</h3>
							<p class="resource_text">
								Big data is now a well-respected practice applied to a new generation of applications, systems, software, and storage architecture, all designed to provide business value from unstructured data.   The move to big data analysis has become an integral part of corporate competition and growth, from the standpoint of competitiveness and the potential capture of value. In most industries, established competitors and new entrants alike now leverage data-driven strategies to innovate, compete, and capture value from deep and up-to-real-time information. There is a growing need for advanced tools, software, and systems that can capture, store, manage, and analyze the data sets, all in a timeframe that preserves the intrinsic value of the data. A3Cube provides an industry first, brain inspired architecture that enhances performance levels to oders of magnitude and nano-second latencies that enable Big Data applications to perform at optimum levels.

							<h3>Manufacturing Without Limits</h3>
							<p class="resource_text">
								Companies increasingly look at the whole world as their market, especially given the soaring cost of developing and manufacturing products. The risk of not meeting ever-increasing customer demand from product and service quality, to new product introductions, delivery, and warranty remains a major concern for manufacturers around the world. Automotive, aerospace, semiconductor and other manufacturing industries face ever-growing challenges to reduce design cycle time and cost and satisfy global regulations on safety and environmental concerns while responding to the increasing demand for high-quality, well-designed products.  The need for production deployment of technical application software and an IT infrastructure for high-fidelity CAE and EDA simulations have become critical tools in the design path of product development. A3Cube's RONNIEE Express technology  provides an architecture that will make a significant difference in real performance and time to completion compared to any kind of other existing products. Our disruptive data plane architecture will help unleash leading manufacturers to meet these global challenges by allowing manufacturers to develop and implement successful strategies, processes, and technologies that align with the global landscape.
